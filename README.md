## Reading Recommendation

For those looking to deepen their understanding of NLP, we highly recommend the textbook **"Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft)"** by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. The book is an excellent resource and is available online for free at [https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/).
